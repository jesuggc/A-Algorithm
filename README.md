# A Star Algorithm
A web project simulator for A* algorithm. Using just Vanilla JS 

Here's a visual example of what the ending product will look like, we based the view on this image

The main goal of this project was to learn how the a* algorithm works on a basic level in under a month. Therefore the algorithm may not always choose the best path from point A to B since we will not be redirecting

## Optimizations

What optimizations did you make in your code? E.g. refactors, performance improvements, accessibility


## License

## Design decissions

Drag and drop wasnt enough
Make the algorithm step by step 

## Lessons Learned

What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?
